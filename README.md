# 📊 Algorithms and Data Structures – AGH Practice & Theory

This repository contains curated notes, examples, and implementations based on the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course conducted at **AGH University of Krakow**.

The course provides a foundation in the design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms and data structures — crucial components of computer science and software engineering.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand fundamental algorithm design paradigms: **Divide & Conquer**, **Greedy**, **Dynamic Programming**
- Master standard **data structures**: arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, graphs, and hash tables
- Analyze computational **complexity** and performance of algorithms
- Apply algorithms to real-world **problem solving** tasks
- Write **efficient, readable and testable code** using modern C

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧮 Algorithms
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion, Selection, Merge Sort, QuickSort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort
- Searching: Binary Search, Linear Search
- Recursion and recursion removal
- Greedy algorithms and their application
- Dynamic programming (e.g., knapsack, longest increasing subsequence)
- Graph algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, Floyd-Warshall
- Maximum flow problem (Ford-Fulkerson)

### 🧱 Data Structures
- Arrays and dynamic arrays
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Stacks and Queues (array- and pointer-based)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)
- Hash Tables (chaining and open addressing)
- Trees: Binary Trees, BST, AVL, B-Trees
- Graph representations: adjacency matrix, list
